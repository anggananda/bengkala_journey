              term referring to individuals born with hearing and speech
              impairments. This unique genetic trait has been passed down
              through generations due to a recessive gene within the community.
              However, what makes the Kolok culture extraordinary is not their
              condition but how they have embraced it and created a vibrant and
              inclusive environment.

              In Bengkala, inclusivity and harmony are at the heart of daily
              life. The Kolok community has developed their own sign language,
              locally referred to as <Text strong>Kata Kolok</Text>, which has
              become an integral part of the village's identity. This sign
              language is unique and distinct from international systems like
              ASL (American Sign Language), as it has evolved organically to
              meet the specific needs of the Kolok people in Bengkala.

              One of the most captivating aspects of Bengkala's cultural

              intricate movements, chanting, and dramatic storytelling. The
              Kolok version of Janger transforms this art form into something
              uniquely beautiful and meaningful.
